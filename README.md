# 🌌 Voxel Space Game

**A galaxy-scale, modular sandbox sim where magic, evolution, and cosmic engineering collide.**

Welcome to the Voxel Space Game — a fully simulated universe built around AEtheric physics, emergent species, and civilization-scale consequences. Players awaken as Shepherds in a broken galaxy, rebuilding systems, uplifting life, and manipulating time itself.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **AEtheric Field Simulation**: Three core particle types (Æ⁺, Æ⁻, AAE) shape matter, magic, and life.
* **Procedural Evolution**: Species develop dynamically from planetary conditions and player interactions.
* **Time Manipulation**: Compress millennia into moments or pause galactic decay via Quantum Relays.
* **AMI Companion**: A personal artificial intelligence guides research, simulation, and narrative.
* **Crystalline Technology**: Construct intelligent items, vehicles, and entire civilizations using AEther Crystals.
* **Emergent Gameplay**: Civilizations, ecosystems, and myths evolve in response to player choices and cosmic entropy.

## 🧬 Core Systems

* 🌠 **Cosmology & AEtherics** — Stars and planetary alignments define metaphysical laws.
* 🧪 **AEtheric Particles** — Fundamental forces of growth (Æ⁺), decay (Æ⁻), and paradox (AAE).
* 🧬 **Biological Simulation** — Trait trees, mutation probabilities, and AEtheric affinities drive evolution.
* 💎 **Infusion Mechanics** — Crystals absorb AEther to create passive or intelligent items.
* 🧠 **Research System** — Active Mind-Palace and passive Idle Research explore tech, culture, and biology.
* 🛠️ **Construction & Tools** — Modular building, mining, drones, and AEtheric logistics.
* 🛰️ **Time & Server Architecture** — Timeline divergence, rollback, and multi-instance persistence.
* 📙 **Tutorial Arc** — “Awakening of the Shepherd” guides the player through identity, research, and galactic shaping.

## 🛠️ Dev & Modding Notes

* Fully **modular** design (e.g., biospheres, traits, events, timelines)
* API interfaces for:

  * Evolution modules
  * Civilization behavior
  * Time manipulation hooks
* Tools planned for creators to add their own species, items, and timelines
* Designed for long-term **persistence and divergence** (multiplayer-supported)

## 🧭 Getting Started (Dev)

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UrukuTelal/Aetherium.git
   ```

2. Set up your environment:

   * Unity / Unreal (TBD)
   * AEtherCore and ServerCore modules required
   * Node/SQL backends for orchestration and persistence

3. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   npm run start:server
   ```

4. Launch client to test tutorial arc or Mind-Palace.
