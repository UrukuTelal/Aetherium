### AEther-Producing Stars
Emit AEtheric Particles from their poles:

- **AEtheron (√Ü‚Å∫)** ‚Äî creation, growth, structure
- **Entropion (√Ü‚Åª)** ‚Äî entropy, decay, dissolution
 
### Anti-AEtheric Stars
Emit **Paradoxon (AAE)** particles:

- Disruption, incoherence, paradox
- Invert or destabilize AEtheric structures
- Rare and inherently mutagenic

---

## 2. üåç Planetary AEtheric Alignment

### Orbital Inclination
- Determines planetary AEtheric polarity.
- Aligned with AE‚Å∫ ‚Üí creative world
- Aligned with AE‚Åª ‚Üí entropic world
- Aligned with AAE ‚Üí paradox world

# Speciation System Design Overview

## Purpose
This document outlines the comprehensive speciation system for the game‚Äôs evolutionary simulation. It serves as a reference for development, ensuring consistency and clarity when expanding or implementing species, environmental factors, and AEtheric influences.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Base Lifeforms
- Life begins with base organisms adapted to their homeworld environment (e.g., Terran plants, Cryonic methane-based phytomorphs).
- Base lifeforms define core biochemical traits:
  - **Base Liquid:** Primary fluid medium for life processes (e.g., water, liquid methane).
  - **Base Chemical:** Core chemical composition (usually carbon-based).
  - **Gas Exchange:** Gases absorbed and emitted.
  - **Energy Source:** Photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, heterotrophic, or AEtheric infusion.

### 2. AEtheric Particles and Fields
- AEtheric particles exist as positive and negative charges and influence mutation rates and biological abilities.
- Organisms have **AEtheric Affinities** (e.g., Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Space, Time) that can be positive (+) or negative (-).
- AEtheric infusion threshold defines the organism‚Äôs capacity to store and manipulate AEtheric particles.
- AEtheric bio-genesis allows organisms to resist anti-AEtheric fields and even radiate anti-AEtheric energy.

### 3. Evolutionary Divergence
- Species evolve based on environmental pressures, AEtheric influence, and ecological roles.
- Predation drives the divergence from stationary to motile lifeforms.
- Mythical creatures emerge only when specific AEtheric conditions and evolutionary paths are met.
- Speciation branches are named by trait or function rather than Terran analogs, e.g., ‚Äúglide_stalkers‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbirds.‚Äù

### 4. Speciation Timeline
- The timeline includes a critical upheaval event (~40,000 years ago) linked to galactic AEtheric warfare.
- Pre-upheaval species naturally maintain a balance of + and - AEtheric particles.
- Post-upheaval species develop AEtheric bio-genesis to counteract anti-AEtheric fields.
- Mythical beings mostly vanish post-upheaval except for those with neutral AEtheric affinity or bio-genesis capability.

---

## Current Speciation Branches

### Cryonic World Lifeforms (Methane Sea Analogous to Europa)
- **Base Cryonic Phytomorph:** Methane-based stationary life with slow metabolism using infrared or chemosynthesis.
- **Cryonic Proto-Animal:** First motile heterotrophs developing predation strategies using AEtheric manipulations.
- Evolution branches include:
  - Glide stalkers
  - Thermo burrowers
  - Vortex siphons

### Terran Animals and Humans
- Multicellular motile base animal with oxygen respiration.
- Mammalian class with subdivisions (aquatic mammals, primates).
- Human line with extensive branching:
  - Post-sapiens with advanced AEtheric traits and cultural evolution.
  - Variants adapted to aquatic, aerial, volcanic, subterranean, and AEtheric-enhanced lifestyles.

---

## Development Notes

- Species entries are structured in JSON for easy parsing and expansion.
- Traits and AEtheric affinities drive gameplay mechanics such as mutation speed, field manipulation, and species interactions.
- AEtheric infusion mechanics will underpin special abilities and resistances.
- Mythical creature branches will require AEtheric prerequisite states before becoming viable.

---

## Next Steps

- Develop herbivore-equivalent lineages on Cryonic worlds.
- Expand predator/prey co-evolution arms race in low-temperature methane environments.
- Define world types with varying atmospheres, liquids, and energy sources supporting diverse life.
- Integrate AEtheric particle and field simulation into mutation and ability systems.
- Flesh out mythical creature speciation across all major branches following AEtheric requirements.

* Shared systems default to `1.0x`, unless **all present players explicitly agree** to a chrono override.
* Override is maintained **only while all consents are active**.
* If **any remaining player revokes consent**, time immediately returns to `1.0x`.

## Time Persistence After Departure

* If one or more players leave a system but others remain and consent persists, **dilation remains active**.
* **Leaving alone does not cancel dilation**; only revoking consent by remaining players does.

## No Perception, No Dilation

* When **no players are present**, the system automatically:

  * Reverts to **galactic default time rate (`1.0x`)**.
  * Switches simulation mode to **"idle"**, reducing simulation fidelity to background processes only.
  * Suspends all active chrono overrides and resets the chrono controller.
